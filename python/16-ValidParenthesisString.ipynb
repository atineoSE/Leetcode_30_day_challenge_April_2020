    "When checking whether the string is valid, we only care about the \"balance\": the number of extra, open left parenthesis as we parse through the string. For example, when checking whether `(()())` is valid, we have a balance of 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0 as we parse through the string: `(` has balance 1, `((` has 2, `(()` has 1, and so on. This means that after parsing the first `i` symbols, (which may include asterisks,) we only need to keep track of what the balance could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have string `(***)`, then as we parse each symbol, the set of possible values for the balance is `[1]` for `(`; `[0, 1, 2]` for `(*`; `[0, 1, 2, 3]` for `(**`; `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` for `(***`, and `[0, 1, 2, 3]` for `(***)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we can prove these states always form a contiguous interval. Thus, we only need to know the left and right bounds of this interval. That is, we would keep those intermediate states described above as `[lo, hi] = [1, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 3]`.\n",

    "If we encounter a left parenthesis `(`, then `lo++`, otherwise we might have a right parenthesis (`*` or `)`), so `lo--`. If we encounter what might be a left parenthesis (`(` or `*`), then `hi++`. If we encounter, a right parenthesis, then `hi--`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If `hi < 0`, then the current prefix can't be made valid no matter what our choices are. Also, we can never have less than 0 open left brackets. At the end, we should check that we can have exactly 0 open left brackets."
